# Assignment-VI
1. What is pointer and explain its applications. Write a program that uses pointers to copy an array of double.

2. Write a function that is passed with an array of n pointers which returns the maximum.

3. Justify that pointer is jewel in C language. Write a function that is passed an array of n pointers to floats and returns a newly created array that contains those n float values in reverse order. Assume any necessary data.

4. Write a function that uses pointers to search for the address of a given integer in a given array. If the given integer is found, the function returns its address; otherwise it returns NULL.

5. Write a program that uses pointers to copy an array of integer.

6. Write a function that is passed an array of n pointer to floats and returns a newly created array that contains those n float values.

7. Explain the pointer to structure with example.

8. Explain the pointer arithmetic with example.

9. Write a program to sort 'n' numbers in ascending order using dynamic memory.

10. What is dynamic memory allocation (DMA)? How can you use it in C?

11. What are the advantages of dynamic memory allocation over static memory allocation?

12. How is malloc() function different from calloc() function?

13. Write a program to read number of employees,n, working in a company. Reserve the memory required to store age of n employees using malloc() function. Read age of n employees from user and count the number of employees of age above 80 years.

14. Write a program to read a matrix of size m*n entered by the user and display its transpose matrix. Use Dynamic Memory Allocation.
